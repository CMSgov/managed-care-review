/**
 * This will help with flaky behavior in cypress where there is a race condition
 * between the test runner and the app itself and its lifecycle. The problem
 * comes from the app detaching DOM elements before cypress runs actions on
 * them.
 *
 * See more details on this thread: https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7306
 * This will probably be natively supported by cypress at some point.
 *
 * The pipe solution comes from this article cypress offers as a workaround the
 * problem for the time being.
