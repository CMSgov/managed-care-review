// Notes for future refactor to single page UI
// We should be overriding usa-form max-width across the application, rather than per form page.  Let uswds always take the width of its parent by default
// From figma seems like like single page page width is 40rem but we have  $mcr-container-standard-width-fixed set to 50rem - look at this in future refactor - cross check with design.
// Are single page forms supposed to be the same width as the state submission form? Probably - in which case we should be sharing as many styles tokens as possible.
