/* 
    Custom application styles
    
    Use caution with this file. Most styles in the application live close to the component in a `*.module.scss` file. The advantage of those files are they are automatically namespaced and scoped to that component. There are some cases, though, where global styles and overrides are needed. Here are examples: 
    1. We are dealing with container elements that repeat throughout the application (divs, cards, display tables)
    2. We need adjust behavior in USWDS that we can't control via setting (list of settings can be found here - https://designsystem.digital.gov/documentation/settings/#general-settings)
    3. We want to hide an element from the screen using our global screenreader only class 
    
   
   If you have determined you still need a change in this file, please use css selectors to target your change precisely and also add a comment inline to your change.
