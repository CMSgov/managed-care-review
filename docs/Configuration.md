# Application Configuration

guide-wire is [configured using env vars](https://12factor.net/config).

Different env vars can be set in different environments [local dev, review apps, dev, staging, prod] to configure things differently.

For local dev, ./dev loads all environment variables set in the `.env` file. `.env_example` is provided (and copied as a default on first run) with settings that should work out of the box locally.

Also, CreateReactApp only loads env vars that start with `REACT_APP_`, so any configuration that needs to be read by app-web must start that way.

## List of Environment Variables

### `REACT_APP_AUTH_MODE`

Read by `app-api` and `app-web`.

valid values: `LOCAL`, `AWS_COGNITO`, `IDM`

This tells the application how to perform authentication.

`LOCAL` means to use local auth. Make no requests to cognito, there is custom auth UI in app-web to pick a user. app-web then sends the user as a JSON blob in a header that serverless-offline dumps into the context of our lambda's execution

`AWS_COGNITO` means to use AWS Cognito User Pools for auth. There is UI for creating and logging in with cognito in app-web and app-api can fetch user information from those users using a cognito api as well.

`IDM` means to use CMS IDM as the auth provider. This is what is set in dev/val/prod. Users will be redirected to login in IDM and then redirected back to our site. Cognito will create users in a special Okta user pool and then everything will work the same as if you were auth'd with `AWS_COGNITO` above.

### `REACT_APP_API_URL`

Read by `app-web`

valid values: A URL where app-api is running

This is the base URL that all requests are sent to from app-web

### `REACT_APP_COGNITO_*`

Read by `app-api`

-   REACT_APP_COGNITO_REGION
-   REACT_APP_COGNITO_ID_POOL_ID
-   REACT_APP_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID
-   REACT_APP_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID
-   REACT_APP_COGNITO_USER_POOL_CLIENT_DOMAIN

These four env vars configure cognito auth from the browser. They are ignored if `REACT_APP_AUTH_MODE` is set to `LOCAL` and thus are only set in deployed environments.

### `APPLICATION_ENDPOINT`

Read by nightwatch

valid values: A URL where a running app-web can be reached

This is used by nightwatch to configure where it tries to reach the app to conduct its testing. Run it locally with ./dev test

### `APP_VERSION`

Read by `app-api`

Generated by ./scripts/app_version.sh as part of the build process, this is a short git hash of the running commit, with '-dirty' appended to it if it's not a clean git checkout.

### `OKTA_METADATA_URL`

Read by `ui-auth`

This is the metatdata URL configured for reaching out to Otka auth.

### `IAM_PATH`
