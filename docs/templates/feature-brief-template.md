# Feature brief: Name of feature
e.g. "File Upload" or "Session Expiration Modal". This is for cases where a product brief was not written but a written outline of design and functionality is needed for future developers.

## Introduction

Discussion of the feature high level.
MC-Review allows users to upload and save files through multiple workflows. FileUpload is the main reusable form field component for this purpose. It supports multiple files at a time via user select or drag and drop.

Currently, the component is embedded inside several larger forms in our application. The file types supported in MC-Review are text based documents (PDF, CSV, DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, XLSM).
