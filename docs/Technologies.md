# Guidewire Technology

These are all pieces of technology we rely on with resources to help learn them.

## DynamoDB

An AWS native datastore.

A great conceptual intro into how tables/indicies work:

-   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.CoreComponents.html
-   https://www.dynamodbguide.com/what-is-dynamo-db

## React Testing Library

Testing library is a javascript test framework for DOM based tests. It lets us write tests where we render into the DOM, then find and interact with elements there like a user would. The library isn't huge so the docs are very accessible.

the expect matchers are from jest-dom: https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom#custom-matchers

## Apollo Client

This is a complicated tool. It handles all the GraphQL operations from the client side, and caches the data locally. The docs are good but it's complicated so building stuff and reading the docs at the same time is the most helpful. There are helpful debugging tools for chrome, pretty much required when getting into the nitty gritty of caching behavior.

### Todo:

-   GraphQL
-   Apollo Server
-   GraphQL Code Generator
-   Typescript
-   Jest?
-   node?
