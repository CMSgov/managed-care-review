# Guidewire Technology

These are all pieces of technology we rely on with resources to help learn them.

## DynamoDB

An AWS native datastore.

A great conceptual intro into how tables/indicies work:

-   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.CoreComponents.html
-   https://www.dynamodbguide.com/what-is-dynamo-db

## React Testing Library

Testing library is a javascript test framework for DOM based tests. It lets us write tests where we render into the DOM, then find and interact with elements there like a user would. The library isn't huge so the docs are very accessible.

the expect matchers are from jest-dom: https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom#custom-matchers

### Todo:

-   GraphQL
-   Typescript
