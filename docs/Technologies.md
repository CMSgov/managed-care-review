# Guidewire Technology

These are all pieces of technology we rely on with resources to help learn them.

## Prisma

An ORM for Typescript + Postgres. We define the tables and relationships we want in our database in our /services/app-api/prisma/schema.prisma file. Prisma generates a typescript client for making queries as well as migrations for changing our database to match the desired state.

## React Testing Library

Testing library is a javascript test framework for DOM based tests. It lets us write tests where we render into the DOM, then find and interact with elements there like a user would. The library isn't huge so the docs are very accessible.

the expect matchers are from jest-dom: https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom#custom-matchers

## Protobuf

Protobuf is a tool for serializing key-value data. Designed for API requests, the serialized format is space efficient and typed. We're using it to encode form data and save it in our database in a single column. Our protobuf schema is located in /services/app-proto/src/state_submission.proto. We serialize our domain models UnlockedHealthPlanFormDataType and LockedHealthPlanFormDataType into byte arrays which we write and read from postgres.

## Apollo Client

This is a complicated tool. It handles all the GraphQL operations from the client side, and caches the data locally. The docs are good but it's complicated so building stuff and reading the docs at the same time is the most helpful. There are helpful debugging tools for chrome, pretty much required when getting into the nitty gritty of caching behavior.

### cypress

We have end to end testing (in the live browser) with [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). This is configured in the main application `/cypress`.

### pa11y

`pa11y` is a tool for accessibility testing. For context, By default, pa11y uses the WCAG2AA standard.

If you would like to run pa11y against individual urls or with custom config as part of local development, consider installing plain ol' [pa11y](https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y) `yarn global add pa11y`. This allows you to do things like `pa11y --runner axe --runner htmlcs --standard WCAG2AAA http://localhost:3000`.

To adjust warning levels, ignore certain types of warnings, or create actions (such as button clicks or user login) that happens in test runs reference the [pa11y configuration docs]((https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y#configuration).

#### pa11y with cypress-audit

We are running pa11y on every page of our form inside of our Cypress tests using the cypress-audit library. This allows us to sign in and fill out the form using Cypress, and only rely on pa11y to scan those pages. This is also one place in our app where we have implemented a ratchet in CI. The issues present when we started testing with pa11y have been ignored, allowing CI to ensure that we aren't adding new errors in the future. Tickets have been filed to address those existing issues.

### Jaeger
Jaeger is used to emulate Open Telemetry behavior for local dev. Read more in the [Jaeger docs](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.35/getting-started/) or visit port [16686](http://localhost:16686)) on local dev.
